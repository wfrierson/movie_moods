# Calculate statistics for each line and each screenplay to later infer
# which lines can be used for the following screenplay components:
#    dialogue, character labels, scene changes, and scene descriptions
#
# These features are inferred by finding patterns in indentations for each
# screenplay. Usually, scene descriptions have the fewest indents. Dialogue
# has more indents than descriptions. Character labels have more indents than
# dialogue (to denote who's speaking). Lastly, scene changes often occur with
# scene descriptions or sometimes on their own indentation level.
#
# Screenplays statistics can be calculated with or without parallel processing.
# The following commented-out code uses no parallel processing (and takes 
# 10 - 15 min), whereas the proceeding code uses parallel processing (and takes
# ~5 min). The non-parallel code can monitored by following the current movie 
# being analyzed which is printed to console.
